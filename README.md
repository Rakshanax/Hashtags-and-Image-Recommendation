# Hashtags-and-Image-Recommendation
Hashtag and Image recommendations for tweets using Machine Learning algorithms and Pexels API Python wrapper library

This study aims to investigate different approaches for recommending hashtags and generating images for those hashtags to encourage their adoption and use. It involves overcoming challenges like noisy data and short content by using pre-processing techniques and using popular supervised learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and KNN classifiers, with a hybrid classifier combining their advantages, to generate the hashtags. The goal is to improve the accuracy of the recommended hashtag by means of using the hybrid classifier.

The Pexels API Python wrapper library is utilized to generate relevant image recommendations for the user hashtags. This enables users to abstract the context of the tweets easily. The main motive is to make the overall Twitter experience smoother for the users.
